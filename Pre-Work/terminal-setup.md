### Terminal Setup

#### Introduction: Terminal emulators
👉 Terminal emulators provide text-based access to the operating system (in contrast to the mostly graphical nature of the user experience of any Operating System, which is managed with your mouse/trackpad).

## 🔴IMPORTANT❗
 ### **_NOTE:_**  ⚠️  A Warning  ⚠️
 
#### 👉 + Before continuing please note that you will see commands prefaced with ` $ ` . For example:

```bash

irene-terminal $ mkdir  js-workshop
$ cd js-workshop
$ code .

```
#### 🤔 👉 The dollar sign denotes the command will be entered into the terminal. You do not need to type it.
