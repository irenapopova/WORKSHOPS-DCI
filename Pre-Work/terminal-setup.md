### Terminal Setup

#### Introduction: Terminal emulators

👉 Terminal emulators provide text-based access to the operating system (in contrast to the mostly graphical nature of the user experience of any Operating System, which is managed with your mouse/trackpad).

## 🔴IMPORTANT❗

### **_NOTE:_** ⚠️ A Warning ⚠️

#### 👉 ❗️ Before continuing please note that you will see commands prefaced with `$` . For example:

```bash

irene-terminal $ mkdir  js-workshop
$ cd js-workshop
$ code .

```

#### 🤔 👉 ❗️ The dollar sign denotes the command will be entered into the terminal. You do not need to type it.

**iTerm2** is a a free replacement for the **OSX terminal** (the default terminal emulator in Apple’s Operating System).

🤔 You may wonder why would we need iTerm2 if we already have a terminal installed.
🛑 **iTerm2** offers us a **host** of extra features we can configure to give us a better experience.

#### Some examples of cool features are:

👉 Split panel view.
👉Hotkey window for instant terminal anywhere.
👉 Mouseless copy.
👉 Along with many more that we’ll learn about later on in this chapter.

### 🛑 Installation

👉 Go to the [downloads](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html) page.
👉 Download the Stable Release.
👉 Decompress the zip file.
👉 In Finder, drag-and-drop the iTerm2 Application file into the Applications folder.
👉Launch iTerm2 by looking for it in the Spotlight Search or clicking on its icon in the App Launcher.

Like in OS X, Terminal is the emulator included in most Linux operating systems. It is the **command-line interface** through which you can type in commands and carry out other text manipulation on Linux.
The **terminal** is a very indispensable tool for system administration. And there are some times when you’d do most of your work on the command-line, like if you are a server admin or programmer.
👉 Install the alternative one called **Terminator**.

**Terminator** was originally created and developed by Chris Jones. Nowadays, it is one of the most popular **terminal emulators** in the **Ubuntu** community.

👉 **Terminator** is a an alternative terminal for **Linux** that comes with a little additional features and functionality that you wont find in the default terminal application.

👉 For instance in terminator you can split your terminal screen both horizontally and vertically as you wish.
👉 The user can also have multiple terminals in one window and use custom key bindings to switch between them.

👉 With terminator a power user can efficiently fill a large area of screen space with terminals.

### Intallation

To install terminator, run the following command:

```js
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install terminator
```

> :warning:🛑 **Remember, we don’t have to type the **`$`\*\*
> So, for:
>
> ```js
> $ sudo apt-get update
> ```
>
> You only have to write **`sudo apt-get update`**.

Be very careful here!
