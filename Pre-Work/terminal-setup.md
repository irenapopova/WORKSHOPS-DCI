### Terminal Setup

#### Introduction: Terminal emulators

👉 Terminal emulators provide text-based access to the operating system (in contrast to the mostly graphical nature of the user experience of any Operating System, which is managed with your mouse/trackpad).

## 🔴IMPORTANT❗

### **_NOTE:_** ⚠️ A Warning ⚠️

#### 👉 ❗️ Before continuing please note that you will see commands prefaced with `$` . For example:

```bash

irene-terminal $ mkdir  js-workshop
$ cd js-workshop
$ code .

```

#### 🤔 👉 ❗️ The dollar sign denotes the command will be entered into the terminal. You do not need to type it.

**iTerm2** is a a free replacement for the **OSX terminal** (the default terminal emulator in Apple’s Operating System).

🤔 You may wonder why would we need iTerm2 if we already have a terminal installed.
🛑 **iTerm2** offers us a **host** of extra features we can configure to give us a better experience.

#### Some examples of cool features are:

👉 Split panel view.
👉Hotkey window for instant terminal anywhere.
👉 Mouseless copy.
👉 Along with many more that we’ll learn about later on in this chapter.

### 🛑 Installation

👉 Go to the [downloads](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html) page.
👉 Download the Stable Release.
👉 Decompress the zip file.
👉 In Finder, drag-and-drop the iTerm2 Application file into the Applications folder.
👉Launch iTerm2 by looking for it in the Spotlight Search or clicking on its icon in the App Launcher.
