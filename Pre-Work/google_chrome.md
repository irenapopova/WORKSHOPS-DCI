Click on it and follow the installation instructions.

### Features

**Google Chrome** has many advantages:

It provides private browsing - prevents the browser from permanently storing any history information or cookies from the websites visited
It has a huge ecosystem of extensions (plug-ins) and themes - These can change the appearance of your browser, or add cool functionality that isn’t natively supported.
It keeps up to date with the latest technologies - Not all browsers render HTML / CSS / JavaScript in the same way. Technologies are constantly evolving, and some browsers are better at keeping up with it than others. Chrome is top tier in this regard.

### Themes

You can add themes by clicking on **Chrome > Preferences** or by typing `Cmd⌘ +`, and opening the Chrome settings view. The third tab, **‘Settings’** displays the appearence options. To change the theme just click on **Get themes** under \*_Appearance_.
