### Methods ðŸ¤”
ðŸ‘‰ Methods are nothing more than properties that hold function values. This is a simple method:
```js
edit & run code by clicking itlet rabbit = {};
rabbit.speak = function(line) {
  console.log(`The rabbit says '${line}'`);
};

rabbit.speak("I'm alive.");
// â†’ The rabbit says 'I'm alive.'
```
ðŸ‘‰ Usually a method needs to do something with the object it was called on. When a function is called as a methodâ€”looked up as a property and immediately called, as in object.method()â€”the binding called this in its body automatically points at the object that it was called on.

```js

function speak(line) {
  console.log(`The ${this.type} rabbit says '${line}'`);
}
let whiteRabbit = {type: "white", speak};
let hungryRabbit = {type: "hungry", speak};

whiteRabbit.speak("Oh my ears and whiskers, " +
                  "how late it's getting!");
// â†’ The white rabbit says 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how
//   late it's getting!'
hungryRabbit.speak("I could use a carrot right now.");
// â†’ The hungry rabbit says 'I could use a carrot right now.'

```

You can think of this as an extra parameter that is passed in a different way. If you want to pass it explicitly, you can use a functionâ€™s call method, which takes the this value as its first argument and treats further arguments as normal parameters.

```js
speak.call(hungryRabbit, "Burp!");
// â†’ The hungry rabbit says 'Burp!'
```
ðŸ‘‰ Since each function has its own this binding, whose value depends on the way it is called, you cannot refer to the this of the wrapping scope in a regular function defined with the function keyword.

ðŸ‘‰Arrow functions are differentâ€”they do not bind their own this but can see the this binding of the scope around them. Thus, you can do something like the following code, which references this from inside a local function:

```js
function normalize() {
  console.log(this.coords.map(n => n / this.length));
}
normalize.call({coords: [0, 2, 3], length: 5});
// â†’ [0, 0.4, 0.6]
```
If I had written the argument to map using the function keyword, the code wouldnâ€™t work.

Objects in JavaScript are collections of key/value pairs. The values can consist of properties and methods, and may contain all other JavaScript data types, such as strings, numbers, and Booleans.

All objects in JavaScript descend from the parent Object constructor. Object has many useful built-in methods we can use and access to make working with individual objects straightforward. Unlike Array prototype methods like sort() and reverse() that are used on the array instance, Object methods are used directly on the Object constructor, and use the object instance as a parameter. This is known as a static method.
