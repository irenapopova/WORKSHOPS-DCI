#### The reason i have prepared those materials is to serve as a learning lab:

All the files in this repo I have build to give a better overview to the new students who are interested in the Web Development course in DCI.
It serves as a PRE-Work for the Web Development Curriculum in the Orientation Course and in the one year course. 

Those materials will help the students to prepare themselves better and it also can always be used as a reference.
This pre-work materials are more like a smooth transition between both curriculums.  

The idea is to have the fundamentals at hand instead of wasting time to search, to use that time in more practice and to focus on building the required DEMO projects for the orientation course.
